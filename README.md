# Grocery list

Create an app allowing users to make their grocery lists.

Here are user stories that should be covered:

- As a user, I can view my grocery list
- As a user, I can add, edit and delete items to my grocery list
- As a user, I can add an amount to each item in the list
- As a user, I can mark an item as bought. This will cross out the title and mark the checkbox as checked.

Technical requirements:
For this task, we want to use NextJS as a framework
Layouts are not strict, but the website should look good on desktop and mobile
Please use JSON-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and React query (https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/quick-start) to mock an API integration
Push your code to the git repo and share a link with the finished project

Not required, but it will be a benefit

- MUI usage to build layouts
- Any additional functionality
- Server-side rendering examples
- Simple NodeJS server instead of JSON-server
