[![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/vviikk/nextjs-research/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/vviikk/nextjs-research/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)

# What is this?
An example app allowing users to make their grocery lists.

Here are user stories that should be covered:

- As a user, I can view my grocery list
- As a user, I can add, edit and delete items to my grocery list
- As a user, I can add an amount to each item in the list
- As a user, I can mark an item as bought. This will cross out the title and mark the checkbox as checked.

Tech stack:
- NextJS
- react-query
- MUI
- Node
- Playwright for e2e tests
- Jest for unit tests
